# Simple form request demo

A simple form request demo in vanilla javascript

## How to run ?

```
npm install
node server.js
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/index` which serves the form. The form sends a GET request to the server (there shouldn't be a problem with cors since the server is running on the same domain(localhost)).
